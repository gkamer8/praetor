# Praetor

This repository contains code to generate and review datasets for chatGPT-like models.

## Secrets

The code expects a python file `secrets.py`, which should look something like:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "openaiapikey"
OPENAI_ORG_ID = "openaiorgid"
```

with your data in the relevant locations.
